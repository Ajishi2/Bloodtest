# Blood Test Analyzer

A FastAPI-based application that uses Google Gemini AI to analyze blood test reports and provide comprehensive health insights. This project combines AI-powered analysis with medical knowledge to help users understand their blood test results.

## üêõ Bugs Found and Fixed During Development

### 1. **Missing LLM Configuration**
- **Bug**: `llm = llm` was undefined in `agents.py`
- **Fix**: Added proper LLM initialization with environment variable support
- **Impact**: System would crash on startup due to undefined variable

### 2. **Missing PDFLoader Import**
- **Bug**: `PDFLoader` was used in `tools.py` but not imported
- **Fix**: Added `from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader`
- **Impact**: PDF reading functionality would fail

### 3. **Incorrect Tool Implementation**
- **Bug**: Tools were defined as async functions but used synchronously
- **Fix**: Converted tools to proper CrewAI BaseTool classes with `_run` method
- **Impact**: Tool execution would fail due to async/sync mismatch

### 4. **Missing Dependencies**
- **Bug**: Several required packages missing from `requirements.txt`
- **Fix**: Added missing dependencies:
  - `python-dotenv==1.0.0`
  - `uvicorn==0.27.1`
  - `python-multipart==0.0.6`
  - `langchain==0.1.0`
  - `langchain-community==0.0.10`
  - `pypdf==3.17.4`
  - `google-generativeai==0.8.5`
- **Impact**: Installation would fail and runtime errors would occur

### 5. **Unprofessional Agent Descriptions**
- **Bug**: Agents had unprofessional, potentially harmful descriptions
- **Fix**: Rewritten all agents with professional, evidence-based medical personas
- **Impact**: System would provide inaccurate or dangerous medical advice

### 6. **Incorrect File Path Handling**
- **Bug**: Main.py used hardcoded file path instead of uploaded file
- **Fix**: Updated to use the actual uploaded file path
- **Impact**: System would analyze wrong file or fail to process uploaded files

### 7. **Hardcoded API Keys**
- **Bug**: API keys were hardcoded in the source code
- **Fix**: Moved to environment variables with proper validation
- **Impact**: Security vulnerability and potential key exposure

### 8. **Incorrect Gemini Model Name**
- **Bug**: Used `gemini-pro` which doesn't exist in current API
- **Fix**: Updated to `gemini-1.5-flash` and `gemini-1.5-pro`
- **Impact**: API calls would fail with 404 errors

### 9. **Missing Environment Configuration**
- **Bug**: No `.env.example` or `.gitignore` for environment variables
- **Fix**: Created proper environment setup files
- **Impact**: Users couldn't set up the project properly

### 10. **Limited Error Handling**
- **Bug**: Poor error handling for API failures and file processing
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks and user-friendly error messages
- **Impact**: System would crash on common errors

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key
- pip (Python package manager)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ajishi2/Bloodtest.git
cd Bloodtest
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Get your Gemini API key from:** [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

### 6. Test the API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Analyze a blood test report
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@data/sample.pdf" \
  -F "query=What are the key findings in my blood test?"
```

## üìñ API Documentation

### Endpoints

#### GET `/`
Health check endpoint
```json
{
  "message": "Blood Test Report Analyser API is running"
}
```

#### POST `/analyze`
Analyze a blood test report

**Parameters:**
- `file` (required): PDF file containing blood test results
- `query` (optional): Specific question about the blood test (default: "Summarise my Blood Test Report")

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "query": "What are the key findings in my blood test?",
  "analysis": "Detailed AI-generated analysis...",
  "file_processed": "blood_test_report.pdf"
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "detail": "Error processing blood report: [error message]"
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API key | Yes |

### Model Configuration

The application uses `gemini-1.5-flash` by default for faster responses. You can modify the model in `main.py`:

```python
gemini_model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')  # Fast
# or
gemini_model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro')    # More detailed
```
